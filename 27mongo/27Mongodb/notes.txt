Comparision of SQL(Structured)and MongoDB(unstructured)
->in sql there might be places where a particular tupple might have some entries missing/empty , but in mongo db its necessary that there will be all entries there in database.

in form many fields are optional if we use sql to store data -> much portion of database in wasted therfore and in mongodb its not the case 


creating databse named "youtube"
use youtube

creating collection
db.createCollection('videos');

deleting the collection named videos
db.videos.drop();

deleting the database we are in 
db.dropDatabse()


// performing crud operation in MongoDB
crud operation

inserting database in products collection
db.products.insertOne({name:"Hari",brand:"Samsung",price:250,category:mobiles})

// showing data in database
db.products.find()

updating data in A  collection named product
db.products.updateOne({name:"Mukul"},{$set:{brand:'vivo'}})

//deleting data from product collection
db.products.deleteOne({brand:"iphone"})
