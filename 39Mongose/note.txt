mongose -> npm package that connects nodejs with mongodb
or its an object modeling tool to work in an asynch env .
Mongoose supports both promises and callbacks.
-> gives few advance options as compared with mongodb
-> we did not had schema and model in mongodb
let say we have id name price brand attribute in our collection , and we dont want any new attribute , this cant be stopped in mongodb but can stopped in mongoose  with the help of schemas

Schema and model difference

schemas - > validate database field in database
